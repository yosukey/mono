/**
 * How the 3D volume ray-march combines the samples along a ray.
 *
 * COMPOSITE is the classic emission-absorption OVER accumulation: nearer
 * samples occlude farther ones, so the result reads as a solid, depth-ordered
 * object. MAXIMUM keeps the single brightest sample per ray instead (maximum-
 * intensity projection) — depth ordering is discarded, which is what makes a
 * sparse bright structure (vessels in an angiogram, labelled structures in a
 * fluorescence stack) visible through everything in front of it.
 *
 * Applies to the 3D render only; a 2D slice draws one plane, where the two
 * modes are identical.
 *
 * MAXIMUM on a CHUNKED (streamed) volume additionally assumes a black
 * background. The per-chunk cube draws are merged with a component-wise MAX
 * blend so the result is independent of chunk draw order, and that max also
 * applies against whatever the tile was cleared to — so a non-black
 * `backColor` is itself a lower bound on every pixel of the cube and washes
 * the projection out. Non-chunked MAXIMUM composites normally and is
 * unaffected. See `_drawChunkedVolume` in gl/render.ts and the
 * `pipelineChunkedMip` variant in wgpu/render.ts.

 * `downsample` (see `chunkLodDownsample`).
 *
 * Downsampling averages voxels, which destroys the correlation between a
 * sample's colour and its opacity; since front-to-back compositing weights
 * colour by opacity, the coarse brick integrates darker than the fine data it
 * stands in for. Each pyramid level averages a fixed 2x2x2 neighbourhood, so
 * the correlation is lost one comparable step PER LEVEL: the exponent falls
 * below 1 (which brightens) in proportion to `log2(downsample)`.
 *
 * Growing it with `downsample - 1` instead - as this did until the deep-level
 * measurements below - assumes level 4 loses eight times what level 1 does.
 * Nothing about averaging works that way, and on a seven-level pyramid it ran
 * away: the level-4 bricks and the whole-volume coarse floor both hit the 0.25
 * clamp at the default coefficient, so a LOD boundary that should have been
 * invisible read as a hard step with the COARSE side far too BRIGHT, and the
 * floor flashed pale every time a refocus swapped the plan.
 *
 * This is still an EMPIRICAL heuristic, not a derivation: the true deficit
 * depends on the intensity variance inside each coarse voxel, which is
 * data-dependent, and no single global exponent nulls it everywhere. What the
 * per-level form buys is that the correction stays monotonic and gentle over
 * the whole useful range instead of saturating, so the coefficient is safe to
 * turn up on data that needs more. Set it to 0 to disable it.
 *
 * Useful magnitudes are SMALL: the default is 0.08 per level and 0.2 is already
 * strong. The returned exponent is floored at 0.25 so a deep level cannot blow
 * out, which is why the accepted range runs to 1 without the top end being
 * useful.
 * Applies only to a multi-LOD chunked volume; on anything else it is an exact

 *
 * Multiplier on a coarse brick's step-size opacity exponent, for a brick whose
 * linear downsample factor is `downsample` (see `chunkLodDownsample`).
 *
 * The ray-march already corrects for a coarse brick taking fewer, longer steps:
 * each sample's alpha is raised to the number of reference steps it stands for,
 * `a' = 1 - (1-a)^k`. That is exact only if the coarse voxel is HOMOGENEOUS.
 * It is not: the true transmittance through the k fine voxels it replaces is
 * `prod(1-a_i)`, and since `log(1-a)` is concave that product is SMALLER than
 * `(1-mean(a))^k`. So a coarse brick is systematically too see-through, by an
 * amount set by the intensity variance inside the coarse voxel. This scales the
 * exponent by `1 + c*(k-1)` to push it back.
 *
 * DEFAULT 0 (off), and that is a measured choice, not an oversight. Simulating
 * the march over a real OME-Zarr pyramid says the variance term is ~0 wherever
 * the structure is dense enough to saturate the ray: those regions already
 * integrate the right alpha, and inflating it only front-loads the march onto
 * the nearer, dimmer samples, which makes the accumulated COLOUR worse. Over
 * four probe regions, raising `c` from 0 to 0.5 cut mean alpha error from 6.7%
 * to 5.1% while driving colour error from 15.3% to 25.7%. Only sparse, thin
 * material has a real alpha deficit, and no single global scale recovers much
 * of it (a -30% deficit improves to -30.6% at c=0.5) because the correction
 * needs the per-voxel variance that mean-downsampling threw away.
 *
 * It is exposed because the trade is data-dependent: a volume that is mostly
 * thin structure gets more from the alpha than it loses on the colour. Use
 * `volumeLodBrightnessCompensation` first; reach for this only if coarse bricks
 * still look too transparent rather than too dark.
 *
 * Ray-march only. A 2D slice tile shows ONE sample with no accumulation, so
 * there is no aggregated alpha to correct there. Applies only to a multi-LOD
 * chunked volume; on anything else it is an exact no-op (ask
